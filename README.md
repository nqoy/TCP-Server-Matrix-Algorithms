# TCP_Server_Matrix_algorithms

Development of a TCP server preforming various algorithmic operations on data matrices.
Wrapping data as nodes and using graph algorithms for calculations.
The algorithmic operations and the handling of server clients are performed in parallel via multithreading.
At the end of each operation the client recives the output of the relevant task.

tasks:
Finding SCC
shortest paths from one index to another
lightest paths from one index to another
number of submarines
